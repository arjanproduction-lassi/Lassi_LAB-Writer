# Worklog

## 2026-07-05

- Added manual Writer DB export/import as the first device bridge.
- Added `Exportovať DB` and `Importovať DB` actions in a small data section.
- Export creates `LassiLAB_Writer_DBv001_YYYY-MM-DD.json`.
- Import validates the Writer DB structure, backs up current local sparks before
  writing, merges by spark `id`, and keeps the newer `updatedAt` version.
- Kept persistence local to `localStorage`.
- Kept cloud sync, accounts, backend, AI, media capture, Songbook integration,
  Storyboard integration, and shared databases out of scope.

## 2026-07-03

- Added the first minimal Vite, React, and TypeScript shell.
- Added a mobile-first dark workshop interface.
- Added the local text spark loop:
  - create a new spark
  - save it locally
  - show recent sparks
  - reopen a spark
  - edit and save again
- Added `src/types.ts` for the v0.1 `Spark` model.
- Added `src/storage.ts` as a small `localStorage` adapter.
- Added a basic web app manifest.
- Kept AI, voice, melody, image upload, integrations, accounts, sync,
  collaboration, and export bridges out of scope.
